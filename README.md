## Summary
The Star Wars API app is my 6th project with SDMMP and 2nd project that was written in React and 1st project I used axios  fetch API data and using async/await. This project was challenging for me and  I struggled quite a bit to correctly access the API data and how to render it properly into my project, I learned a lot through the process and have gotten a lot more confident about programming with React using state and hooks. I'm super happy to improve my skills and head to the next challenge(project).
